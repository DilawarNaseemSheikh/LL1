# Translations

This document is a step by step guide for how to add translations to this application. Translations are currently only available for the upcomming public release.

1. Fork and checkout the repository
2. Change to the develop branch
3. Copy one of the already existing locale files in `src/locales`
4. Edit the name of the file to the language's name
5. Edit the language code inside that file
6. Finally, add your language's name inside the `languages.info` file
7. Commit your updated files
8. Submit a pull request back to the LL1_Compiler repository

Before completing and submiting your pull request, please make sure everything works as intended, by running the actual application and testing it.
